<#1. get all processes that have chrome or host in the process name #>


<#2. let's use Group-Object to group our output by processName for 
the cmdlet above#>


<#3 how would you figure out what properties were available to you
after you have grouped the data in #2? #>



<#4 let's put this all together now. Write the cmdlet that outputs how many 
processes are running that have chrome or host in the process name#>


<#5 add to the strategy in #5 to output the processes that has the most 
running in the group #>


<#6 what cmdlet can you use to show MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG data? #>


<# use the cmdlet in #6 to show the lowest and highest handles count
for all processes#>
